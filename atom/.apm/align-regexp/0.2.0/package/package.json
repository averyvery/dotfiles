Select something\n2. Type `ctrl+alt+a`, or whatever keybinding you assigned.\n   The command name is `align-regexp:align-selection`.\n3. Enter a regexp in the mini-editor and press enter. It will often be a single char, like `=` or `:`,\n   but can also be for example `from` to align ES6 imports.\n\n## Known limitations\n\nThis package does not handle full-width chars, such as Japanese or Chinese.\nIf someone wants to send a PR to support it, I will be glad to merge it.\n\n## Comparison to alternatives\n\nThere are a lot of packages for this task, most of them try to be smart.\nThis ones tries to be stupid, so you have to enter explicitly on which\nregexp you want to align.\nI was using [atom-alignment](https://github.com/Freyskeyd/atom-alignment) before creating this package.\nPick the one that fits your needs the best.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/tuvistavie/atom-align-regexp/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/tuvistavie/atom-align-regexp#readme","_id":"align-regexp@0.2.0","_shasum":"cf47556cfadd000df7cc3e5e2b8a2669c86246c7","_resolved":"file:../d-116711-12313-1tj4e8w/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116711-12313-1tj4e8w/package.tgz"}
