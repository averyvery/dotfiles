No soup\nfor you!');\n//  'This thing should be true but you set to false. No soup for you!'\n```\n\nSimilar to Facebook's invariant but only logs a warning if the condition is not met.\nThis can be used to log issues in development environments in critical\npaths. Removing the logging code for production environments will keep the\nsame logic and follow the same code paths.\n\n## Browserify\n\nWhen using [browserify](http://browserify.org/), the `browser.js` file will be imported instead of `invariant.js` and browserify will be told to transform the file with [envify](https://github.com/hughsk/envify). The only difference between `browser.js` and `invariant.js` is the `process.env.NODE_ENV` variable isn't cached. This, in combination with envify and (optionally) [uglifyjs](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS), will result in a noop in production environments. Otherwise behavior is as expected. \n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<small>Don't Forget To Be Awesome</small>\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"warning@2.1.0","_shasum":"21220d9c63afc77a8c92111e011af705ce0c6901","_resolved":"https://registry.npmjs.org/warning/-/warning-2.1.0.tgz","_from":"https://registry.npmjs.org/warning/-/warning-2.1.0.tgz"}
