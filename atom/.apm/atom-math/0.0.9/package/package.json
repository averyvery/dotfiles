Commands implemented so\nfar are:\n\n- `printFunctions` returns a list of all the functions defined in the history\n- `clearHistory` empties the history content\n- `clipHistory` copies history into clipboard\n- `help` prints the full command list\n\n```\nf(x) = 1 + 3 * x\n> saved\ng(x) = 1 - 3 * x\n> saved\n/functionList\n>\nf(x) = 1 + 3 * x\ng(x) = 1 - 3 * x\n/help\n> Full command list below\nfunctionList - Print a list of all defined functions\nclearHistory - Empty the history\nclipHistory - Copy history into clipboard\nhelp - Print the full command list\n```\n\n### Definite integration (:exclamation::exclamation:**EXPERIMENTAL**:exclamation::exclamation:)\nDefinite integration may be executed in `atom-math` with the usage of\n[this awesome](https://github.com/scijs/integrate-adaptive-simpson)\npackage from [scijs](https://github.com/scijs). This feature is **still\nunstable**, so it does not behave as expected when provided evaluation\npoints are floating point. Please refer to [this issue](https://github.com/scijs/integrate-adaptive-simpson/issues/1) to get some examples of how the malfunction can manifest.\n\nThe current integrate function status will be tracked [here](https://github.com/b3by/atom-math/issues/7).\n\n## `integrate(functionName, startPoint, endPoint, tolerance)`\n\nA simple integration usage example follows:\n```\nf(x) = x + 3\n> saved\nintegrate(f, 0, 10, 0.1)\n> 80\n```\n\n### Command history\nCommand history can be navigated by using `ctrl-up` and `ctrl-down`. Browsing\nthe command history implies that the current line is emptied and replaced either\nwith a command when any is available in that direction, or with an empty line.\n\n### Like what you see?\nPlease feel free to contribute anyway you feel might be useful. New feature suggestions\nor merge requests are more than welcome!\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/b3by/atom-math/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/b3by/atom-math#readme","_id":"atom-math@0.0.9","_shasum":"c4aa73da62a89c3bec9e1415a14efdab572e0234","_resolved":"file:../d-116513-18848-dpcb1z/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116513-18848-dpcb1z/package.tgz"}
