One of the features is the ability to use ES6/ES2015 modules now, even though browsers do not yet support this feature natively.\n\n```js\nimport $ from \"jquery\";\n```\n\n#### Browserify/Webpack\n\nThere are several ways to use [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/). For more information on using these tools, please refer to the corresponding project's documention. In the script, including jQuery will usually look like this...\n\n```js\nvar $ = require(\"jquery\");\n```\n\n#### AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition)\n\nAMD is a module format built for the browser. For more information, we recommend [require.js' documentation](http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html).\n\n```js\ndefine([\"jquery\"], function($) {\n\n});\n```\n\n### Node\n\nTo include jQuery in [Node](nodejs.org), first install with npm.\n\n```sh\nnpm install jquery\n```\n\nFor jQuery to work in Node, a window with a document is required. Since no such window exists natively in Node, one can be mocked by tools such as [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom). This can be useful for testing purposes.\n\n```js\nrequire(\"jsdom\").env(\"\", function(err, window) {\n\tif (err) {\n\t\tconsole.error(err);\n\t\treturn;\n\t}\n\n\tvar $ = require(\"jquery\")(window);\n});\n```\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"jquery@2.2.4","_shasum":"2c89d6889b5eac522a7eea32c14521559c6cbf02","_resolved":"https://registry.npmjs.org/jquery/-/jquery-2.2.4.tgz","_from":"https://registry.npmjs.org/jquery/-/jquery-2.2.4.tgz"}
