As an example, while editing `/Users/joe/Projects/xyz/src/client/test.coffee` coverage information could be pulled from either `/Users/joe/Projects/xyz/src/coverage/lcov.info` or `/Users/joe/Projects/xyz/coverage/lcov.info`. (First match as found.)\n\n![Coverage with line highlight](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacogr/atom-lcov-info/master/screenshots/coverage-01.png)\n\nIt supports LCOV information as generated by tools such as Mocha, Karma, Istanbul, and others.\n\n### Why\n\nSome reasons why this package might fit the bill for you -\n\n- Coverage information can be toggled for all views using `ctrl-alt-c`\n- There is no additional configuration, your `coverage/lcov.info` file is automatically located\n- Highlights are configurable to either show as a line (default) or in the gutter (less obtrusive)\n- Both relative and absolute file paths outputs in the `lcov.info` file are supported\n- It does matching irrespective of the platform, i.e. mix-and-match of / and \\ style paths are supported\n- A summary of the total coverage per line is displayed on the statusbar\n- A overall project summary is available, along with at-point views of the different project files\n- Covered lines are highlighted in green, uncovered lines in red\n- Coverage display can be configured for gutter-only, line & gutter\n- Unobtrusive options to only display uncovered lines are available\n- Has been tested with Karma, Mocha and Istanbul outputs\n\n### How\n\nRun your tests, generate a `coverage/lcov.info` file, toggle the coverage plugin and it displays.\n\n### Where\n\nThe Atom package can be found on the Atom registry, [https://atom.io/packages/lcov-info](https://atom.io/packages/lcov-info).\n\nPull requests, issues, feature requests are all welcome and encouraged via [https://github.com/jacogr/atom-lcov-info](https://github.com/jacogr/atom-lcov-info).\n\n### More\n\n![Coverage with gutter highlight](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacogr/atom-lcov-info/master/screenshots/coverage-02.png)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jacogr/atom-lcov-info/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/jacogr/atom-lcov-info#readme","_id":"lcov-info@0.11.0","_shasum":"8c23c4f629d38680cae51142712d7d0fc91e8889","_resolved":"file:../d-116420-18158-1tzomwf/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116420-18158-1tzomwf/package.tgz"}
