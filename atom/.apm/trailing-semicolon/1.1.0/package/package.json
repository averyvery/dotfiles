The context menu can also be used in the editor, see the `\"Trailing...\"` sub-menu.\n\nTwo commands aren't binded to any keys by default : `trailing-semicolon:semicolon-newline` and `trailing-semicolon:comma-newline`. They have the same behavior as the default commands but also start a new line (exactly as `ctrl-enter` would do).\n\n## Known issues\n* The key bindings conflict with default configuration, you can change this in your `keymap.cson` file using `trailing-semicolon:semicolon` and `trailing-semicolon:comma` commands (or `application:show-settings`).","engines":{"atom":">0.50.0 <2.0.0"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/pimartin/trailing-semicolon/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/pimartin/trailing-semicolon#readme","_id":"trailing-semicolon@1.1.0","_shasum":"cd6fb6b08f3a8d65c6df6dcdb7cfa8a437ef5223","_resolved":"file:../d-11643-12405-3lrv4q/package.tgz","_from":"../d-11643-12405-3lrv4q/package.tgz"}
