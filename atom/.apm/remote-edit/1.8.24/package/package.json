This includes passwords and passphrases.\n * Passwords and passphrases can alternatively be stored in the systems __default keychain__ by enabling it in the settings page for remote-edit. This is achieved using [node-keytar](https://github.com/atom/node-keytar) and might not work on all systems.\n\n## Keyboard shortcuts\n<kbd>Shift+e</kbd>\nEdit hosts. Usable when selecting hosts (_Browse_).\n\n<kbd>Shift+d</kbd>\nDelete hosts or downloaded files. Usable when selecting hosts (_Browse_) or open files (_Show open files_).\n\n\n### Windows / Linux specific\n<kbd>Ctrl+Alt+b</kbd>\nSelect host.\n\n<kbd>Ctrl+Alt+o</kbd>\nShow downloaded files.\n\n### Mac OS X specific\n<kbd>Ctrl+Cmd+b</kbd>\nSelect host.\n\n<kbd>Ctrl+Cmd+o</kbd>\nShow downloaded files\n\n\n## Tips and tricks\n### SSH auth with password fails\nOn some sshd configuration (Mac OS X Mavericks), if _PasswordAuthentication_ is not explicitly set to yes, ssh server will not allow non-interactive password authentication. See [this issue](https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2/issues/154) for more in-depth information.\n\n### Agent authentication when using SSH\nThe package uses [ssh2](https://github.com/mscdex/ssh2) to connect to ssh servers, and also use the default construct in this package to authenticate with an agent.\nOn Windows, the agent will be set to \"pageant\", otherwise it assumes a \\ix system and uses \"process.env['SSH_AUTH_SOCK']\" to get the agent.\nThis can be overridden in the settings.\n\n## Screenshot\n### Available commands\n![Available commands](http://imgur.com/dS9a0CZ.png)\n\n### Add a new FTP host\n![Adding a new FTP host](http://imgur.com/dEVvXd6.png)\n\n### Add a new SFTP host\n![Adding a new SFTP host](http://imgur.com/4Kq3kwh.png)\n\n### Edit existing host\n![Editing an existing host](http://imgur.com/GgXh5qQ.png)\n\n### Select host\n![Select host](http://imgur.com/BediXn9.png)\n\n### Browse host\n![Browsing host](http://i.imgur.com/RwvMgFH.png)\n\n### Show downloaded files\n![Show open files](http://imgur.com/wpTTBQt.png)\n\n\n## Settings window\n![Settings window for remote-edit](http://imgur.com/8BG2Mz7.png)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"remote-edit@1.8.24","_shasum":"ecc641b6b4bbd1614535a9028ee9e0c751652557","_resolved":"file:../d-116319-19916-1miycun/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116319-19916-1miycun/package.tgz"}
