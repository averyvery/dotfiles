The diff is updated when any changes are made. New panes are created if less than two panes exist upon run of the package.\n\n![Split Diff in action](https://github.com/mupchrch/split-diff/raw/master/demo.gif)\n\n## Usage\n\nThe **Diff Panes** command is unique; it will create panes as necessary. Here are the situations that could arise:\n\n* If there are **no panes** open, then it will create two *empty* panes to paste your diffs into.\n* If there is **one pane** open, then it will diff the pane against a newly created *empty* pane to paste your diff into.\n* If there are **two panes** open, then it will diff the two panes.\n* If there are **more than two panes** open, then it will diff the first two panes it finds.\n\nTo stop diffing, simply close one of the panes *or* use the **Disable** command.\n\n*This package will unfold all folded lines in order to properly align the diff.*\n*It will also temporarily turn off soft wrap in the two panes in order to properly align the diff.*\n\n### Commands\n\n| Command | Effect | Default Keymaps |\n| ------- | ------ | --------------- |\n| **Diff Panes** | Diffs text between two side-by-side panes.
