So you can use your shared variables & mixins across all SASS styles without manually importing them in each file. Made to work with CSS Modules!\n\n## Installation\n\nGet it via npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm install sass-resources-loader\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nCreate your file (or files) with resources:\n\n```scss\n/* resources.scss */\n\n$section-width: 700px;\n\n@mixin section-mixin {\n  margin: 0 auto;\n  width: $section-width;\n}\n```\n\n**NB!** Do not include anything that will be actually rendered in CSS, because it will be added to every imported SASS file.\n\nProvide path to the file and apply loader in webpack config:\n\n```js\n/* webpack.config.js */\n\nmodule: {\n  loaders: [\n    // Apply loader\n    { test: /\\.scss$/, loader: 'style!css!sass!sass-resources' },\n  ],\n},\n\n// Provide path to the file with resources\nsassResources: './path/to/resources.scss',\n\n// Or array of paths\nsassResources: [ './path/to/vars.scss', './path/to/mixins.scss' ]\n```\n\nNow you can use these resources without manually importing them:\n\n```scss\n/* component.scss */\n\n.section {\n  @include section-mixin; // <--- `section-mixin` is defined here\n}\n```\n\n```js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport css from './component.scss';\n\n// ...\n\nrender() {\n  return (\n    <div className={css.section} />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Contributing\nThis project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\nSee [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.\n\n## License\nMIT.\n\n## Example and Related Libraries\n\n* [react-webpack-rails-tutorial](https://github.com/shakacode/react-webpack-rails-tutorial/), live example at [www.reactrails.com](http://www.reactrails.com/).\n* [bootstrap-loader](https://github.com/shakacode/bootstrap-loader/)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","homepage":"https://github.com/shakacode/sass-resources-loader#readme","_id":"sass-resources-loader@1.0.2","_shasum":"700ded47907bf7f7f6645c75139df0ea78b9affa","_resolved":"https://registry.npmjs.org/sass-resources-loader/-/sass-resources-loader-1.0.2.tgz","_from":"https://registry.npmjs.org/sass-resources-loader/-/sass-resources-loader-1.0.2.tgz"}
