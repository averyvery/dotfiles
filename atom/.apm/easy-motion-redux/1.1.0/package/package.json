Jump to any word in your current view super fast.\n\n* * *\n\n**Note:** this package is a partial rewrite of the great [easy-motion package](https://github.com/adrian-budau/easy-motion) from Adrian Budau.\n\nThe original package seems dead and, with the deprecation of the atom API pre-1.0, it's sad that we can't use easy-motion in atom anymore. So, i rewrite the package, waiting for news from Adrian.\n\n* * *\n\nCheck out that repository to better understand what this plugin does.\n\n## Modes\n\nBy default the characters used for markers are **ABC....Z**.
