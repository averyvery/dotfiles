A replacement can be any string. They are replaced in the following places:\n\n- In the value of a declaration, i.e. `color: my_symbol;` or `box-shadow: 0 0 blur spread shadow-color`\n- In a media expression i.e. `@media small {}` or `@media screen and not-large {}`\n\n## License\n\nISC\n\n---\nGlen Maddern, 2015.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"icss-replace-symbols@1.0.2","_shasum":"cb0b6054eb3af6edc9ab1d62d01933e2d4c8bfa5","_resolved":"https://registry.npmjs.org/icss-replace-symbols/-/icss-replace-symbols-1.0.2.tgz","_from":"https://registry.npmjs.org/icss-replace-symbols/-/icss-replace-symbols-1.0.2.tgz"}
