This is a non-zero value, but you may not make any other assumptions about its value.\n\n## raf.cancel(handle)\n\n`handle` is the entry identifier returned by `raf()`. Removes the queued animation frame callback (other queued callbacks will still be invoked unless cancelled).\n\n## raf.polyfill()\n\nShorthand to polyfill `window.requestAnimationFrame` and `window.cancelAnimationFrame` if necessary (Polyfills `global` in node).\n\n# Acknowledgments\n\nBased on work by Erik Möller, Paul Irish, and Tino Zijdel (https://gist.github.com/paulirish/1579671)\n\n# license\n\nMIT\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/chrisdickinson/raf/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/chrisdickinson/raf#readme","_id":"raf@3.2.0","_shasum":"2aba9a09bb70f8c2e9094dc60ace7c374fadec7e","_resolved":"https://registry.npmjs.org/raf/-/raf-3.2.0.tgz","_from":"https://registry.npmjs.org/raf/-/raf-3.2.0.tgz"}
