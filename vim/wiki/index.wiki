Write brian regan post

Personal:
  Jenn wedding

Shure:
  Standardize the damn headline stuff
  Standardize on the normal "page" layout
    Includes "coming soon", "images for download", so much more
    "pages-hd" ugh
  Discontinued views don't match current site
    Headlines in wrong place
    No pagination
  Undeveloped pages:
    product comparison
    news/events
  onImgError
  Aria roles
  Microdata
  Product Comparison Styles
  Cleanup existing sections

Viget:
  Orientation docs - PHP, etc
  Labshare idea?
  OOCSS
    PM - markup is never done
    UX - all units have names and visual variations
    DESIGNERS - watch for repeatable styles
    DEVS - let us know where we can simplify markup

Open Sores:
  Freeway - wildcard routing not actually happening

Computer:
  Self github hooks - CSS, lint
