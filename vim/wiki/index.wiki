PERSONAL
 - Goals + intermediate steps
 - How to start lucid?
 - Meditation god dammit
 - Freeway - wildcard routing not actually happening

IDEAS
 - Play with coffeescript
 - Play with Backbone?
 - Use http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3130 to bind start/end jumps?
 - Better git mv
 - Using box-sizing and border-width to pad
 - just have to remember to give explicit widths to ie7 for any elements that use box-sizing
 - rem: https://github.com/vigetlabs/penn-admissions/blob/master/assets/sass/_mixins.scss
 - what's the advantage of using rems in the font-size mixin?
