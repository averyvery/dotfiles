Open Sores:
  Freeway - wildcard routing not actually happening
  Hieroglyph - -,?
  Hieroglyph - tests
  Hieroglyph - fontSquirrel?
    So, follow up on that SVG/Font Squirrel thing we were talking about yesterday: http://www.fontsquirrel.com/forum/discussiâ€¦
  Turns out SVG inclusion isn't part of the default "Optimal" package anymore. If you go to "Custom" and check SVG, you'll get an SVG version of the font.
  Sorry, make that "Expert" instead of "Custom"

Shure:
  New views:
    Artists
  Better toggling
  Idea: Rename section to "s", block to "b"?

Personal:
  vim: remapping dd in jshint
  Top/bottom of screen in vim
  Goals?
  Jenn wedding
  let s:jshintrc_file = expand('~/.jshintrc')
  jshint - not use the Quickfix window?
