* swiping a too-narrow object left bounds it to the right side? 
* right dragging is weird
* is overflow hidden necessary?
* better pattern: screen, pane, wrapper, child are all "DomObjects", with their own "bind", "measure" methods
* awwwww yeahhhhh Slider.prototype.subscribe = function(hook, fn) {
    if (this.hooks[hook] === undefined) {
      this.hooks[hook] = [];
    }
    this.hooks[hook].push(fn);
  };
