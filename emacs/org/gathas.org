What is this? I don't know.
This drink is my cup of mindfulness, I hold the present moment in my hand.
This food is the gift of the whole universe, the earth, the sky, and much hard work.
I have arrived, I am home, in the here, and the now, I am solid, I am free, in the ultimate, I dwell.
The car is my legs, it goes where I please, when I drive with awareness, everyone arrives in safety.
Chasing after the world brings chaos, allowing it to come to me brings peace.
Each dish I wish is my most cherished child, each movement contains boundless love.
Falling asleep, I voew with all things to enjoy the dark and silence, and rest in the great unknown.
As I view my email I mindfully consider How to bring peace To other beings
Tracking my time I am aware that the present Is all there is
Sitting down I am focused on my task
