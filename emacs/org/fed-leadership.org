Example:

I had lunch with Todd today. It was a good chat. Most of the conversation centered around MassGen and the general struggles we're facing as we approach larger projects with more politically charged and dysfunctional stakeholder groups.

The quick version:

 • 8.9 hrs/day and 89% utilization for the past six months. Time report and charts are attached.
 • As we know, MassGen has indeed been demoralizing and tough. Motivation and fulfillment levels for Todd are pretty low.
 • Some professional dev time lately is helping him to get amped back up.
 • He's ok with working on MassGen phase two. Knows we can't leave them hanging, thankful that they're happy with our work.
 • With that said, he reiterated that a product-focused project to balance with MassGen work would be ideal. If not product-ish, just something smallish with some interesting problems to solve and the potential for innovation.
 • He's not looking around at other jobs, it's not nearly that bad. He's dedicated, just needs to get inspired right now through non-Mass-Gen avenues.
 • Happy with Viget and the UX team and Fox as UX Director. Proud of how we're growing.
