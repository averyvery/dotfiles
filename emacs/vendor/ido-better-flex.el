;;; ido-better-flex.el --- A better flex (fuzzy) algorithm for Ido.

;; URL: http://github.com/vic/ido-better-flex
;; Version: 0.0.2
;; Keywords: ido, flex, fuzzy, match, algorithm

;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package implements just another algorithm for fuzzy matching.
;;
;; To use it with as IDO's default matching algorithm, add the following
;; to your emacs initialization file:
;;
;;     (require 'ido-better-flex)
;;     (ido-better-flex/enable)
;;
;;
;; `ido-better-flex' matches the list of candidates against a single
;; abbreviation by using the function `ido-better-flex/match'.
;; basically for each candidate the algorithm calculates an score based
;; on the characters that make the abbreviation and their position in
;; the candidate string. Unlike default flex match, the present one
;; allows you to match characters even if they are not forward the
;; already matched portion. That is, if a char if not found by forward-search
;; we try to match it backwards. So for example: the 'instpkg'
;; abbreviation will match both: 'package-install' and 'install-package'
;; but the second will get a higher score as all
;; matched characters were forward-matched and we did not backtrack.
;;
;; The matching algorithm implemented in this file is not limited to
;; ido, you could easily use it to do fuzzy matching in other packages,
;; the main entry point for that purpose is the `ido-better-flex/score'
;; function.

(defun ido-better-flex/build-score (string abbreviation)
  "Calculates the fuzzy score of matching `string' with `abbreviation'.
   The score is a float number calculated based on the number characters
   from `abbreviation' that match `string' and how immediate they are to each other.

   For example, for an `abbreviation' of 'instpkg', the score of

      'package-install' is 6.5819

   and for

      'install-package' is 7.9400

   meaning that the second one will appear first on text completion.

   The numbers left to the decimal point are the count of how many
   characters did match on a forward search, eg, in the first example,
   'instpkg' matches 'inst' from chars 8 then has to backtrack for p but
   'kg' are forward-found again, so the number of forward-matched chars is 6.
   This means that abbreviations having not to backtrack are high scored
   as it is a better extact match.

   The numbers right to the decimal point are the ratio of how many
   chars did matches in the string from the start position.
